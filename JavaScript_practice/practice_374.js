// It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. 
// The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and 
// entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script.

// Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

// The array will never be empty.
