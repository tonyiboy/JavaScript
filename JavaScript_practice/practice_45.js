// Use destructured assignment to create a const variable named functionality that extracts the functionality property of robot.

// If you need a reminder on how to use destructured assignment, review the example in the narrative or check the hint.

// Since functionality is referencing robot.functionality we can call the methods available to robot.functionality 
// simply through functionality.

// Take advantage of this shortcut and call the .beep() method on functionality.
